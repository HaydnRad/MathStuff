# MathStuff
Just a random collection of math related programs, usually meaninglessly crunching problems I've seen on youtube where the mathematician used Python to do the same thing. (cough cough Matt Parker cough)

This is mostly just for fun, but I'll also be doing this to practise ways of speeding my programs up.
I'll be doing various things from just general optimisation, to using bitwise operations, and maybe parallelisation or even coding for GPUs eventually.
